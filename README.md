# Shoe Collection App

## Description
The Shoe Collection App is designed to display a collection of shoes in a user-friendly interface. It features a grid layout with interactive elements that allow users to view detailed information about each shoe, such as the name, brand, price, and the number of items left in stock. Users can interact with the app by adding shoes to their cart, editing shoe details, or removing items from the collection.

## Features
- **Responsive Layout**: The app is fully responsive and adjusts its display to suit various screen sizes. It shows 4 items per row on desktop, 2 items per row on medium-sized screens, and 1 item per row on smaller screens.
- **Hover Effects**: Each shoe card has a hover effect that adds an interactive visual cue, making the user interface more engaging.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Users can add shoes to their cart, edit shoe details, and delete shoes directly from the card interface.
- **Background Image**: The app is visually enhanced with a background image that complements the shoe collection theme, providing a vibrant and dynamic look.
- **Smooth Animations**: The shoe cards feature smooth animations such as a hover effect that scales the card slightly, adding a modern touch to the user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the app.
- **CSS3**: For styling the app's components and implementing responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- **JavaScript (React)**: React is used to build the appâ€™s dynamic user interface, manage state, and handle user interactions.
